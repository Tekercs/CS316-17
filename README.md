### Books

There are now many books written about Haskell. Here are links to some
that we have found useful.

- [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html)
  is the book that we have based the first half of this course on. You
  do not need to buy the book.

- The [Haskell Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell). This
  is a free online book that starts very gently, but also includes
  some very advanced material.

- [Learn You a Haskell for Great
  Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). The full text of this book is
  available online for free.
